        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The first web browser was invented in 1990 by 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">Tim Berners-Lee</a>. 
            It was called WorldWideWeb (no spaces) and was later renamed Nexus. In 1993, 
            Marc Andreessen created a browser that was easy to use and install with the release of Mosaic 
            (later Netscape), "the world's first popular browser".
        </p>
        <p>
            The browser wars put the Web in the hands of millions of ordinary PC users, 
            but commercialization of the Web could stymie standards efforts. 
            Both Microsoft and Netscape liberally incorporated proprietary extensions to HTML 
            to gain an edge by product differentiation, leading to W3Câ€™s adoption of CSS.

                The first Internet Explorer was derived from

                The original Mosaic came from

                but Microsoft adapted it for their browser.
