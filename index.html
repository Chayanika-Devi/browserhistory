    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Web browsers have been a cornerstone in how people access the internet for decades. 
      From their earliest days to the modern multi-tabbed, extension-enabled experiences, 
      browsers have continually evolved alongside web standards. They shape how we view, 
      create, and interact with online content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, browsers have become more secure, more standards-compliant, 
      and have expanded to include tools for developers, advanced privacy options, 
      and integrations with cloud services. It’s hard to imagine modern life 
      without these powerful applications.

    <h2>A brief history of IE</h2>

    <p>
      Internet Explorer (IE) was introduced by Microsoft in 1995, quickly becoming one 
      of the most widely used browsers due to its bundling with Windows. Over the years, 
      IE received numerous updates, though it sometimes lagged in adopting new web standards. 
      Despite declining usage in later years, its early dominance played a key role in 
      popularizing the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      After many versions, Microsoft officially ended support for older IE versions and 
      transitioned users to Microsoft Edge. While IE’s market share has dramatically 
      decreased, it remains a significant part of browser history.

    <h2>A brief history of Firefox</h2>

    <p>
      Firefox, developed by the Mozilla Foundation, was first released in 2002 under the name 
      “Phoenix.” It quickly became popular thanks to its open-source nature, focus on privacy, 
      and commitment to web standards. Over time, Firefox introduced pioneering features 
      such as tabbed browsing and robust add-ons, influencing the broader browser market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite facing stiff competition from other browsers, Firefox continues to have 
      a dedicated user base. Mozilla’s emphasis on an open and accessible internet 
      remains at the core of Firefox’s identity.

    <h2>A brief history of Chrome</h2>
    <img src="c.jpg" width="100" alt="IE Logo" />
    <p>
      Google Chrome was launched in 2008 and rapidly gained market share, 
      becoming one of the most widely used browsers in the world. Its speed, 
      minimalist design, and integration with Google services appealed to users, 
      and the frequent updates kept Chrome on the cutting edge of web technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, Chrome extended its platform to include powerful developer tools, 
      a vast library of extensions, and cross-device synchronization. Its dominance 
      has influenced modern web standards and shaped the competitive landscape 
      of browser development.
